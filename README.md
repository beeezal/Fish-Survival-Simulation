# Fish-Survival-Simulation

A repo to contian part of my **Honors Thesis Project** (whose current codes are also maintained [here](https://github.com/beeezal/Honours-project-codes)).

## Purpose

Creating a mini-2D simulation of a _prey-perdator system_, where the environment is the sea and the objects are fishes. More complex ideas are introduced to showcase my learnings from my thesis research.
